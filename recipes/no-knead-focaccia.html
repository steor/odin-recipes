    <i><p>It holds big bubbles in the baked dough and because of the long fermentation time, has a far superior flavour.</p></i>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>4 x cups bread flour</li>
    <li>2 x tablespoons bread flour</li>
    <li>¼ x teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
    <li>2 x teaspoons kosher salt</li>
    <li>4 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil, or more as needed</li>
    <li>1⅔ x cups water, at room temperature</li>
    <li>1 x tablespoon minced fresh rosemary</li>
    <li>1 x tablespoon flaky sea salt</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Stir yeast into bread flour in a bowl. Add salt, followed by 4 teaspoons oil, and water. Stir with a spoon until a wet, sticky dough forms.</li>
    <li>Cover and let sit at room temperature for 12 to 14 hours.</li>
    <li>Uncover dough and transfer to an oiled work surface. Using oiled hands, press and push the dough into a rectangle, 16x12 inches in size. Fold dough into thirds horizontally; fold vertically into thirds. Transfer smooth side up into a generously oiled pan.
    </li>
    <li>Cover the pan with plastic wrap and let rest until almost doubled in size, for 1 hour.</li>
    <li>Using oiled hands, fold once more into thirds horizontally, then into thirds vertically to develop gluten structure. Flip dough, smooth side up, on the pan; cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 1 hour more.</li>
    <li>Unwrap and stretch and fold dough once more in each direction using oiled hands.</li>
    <li>Transfer, smooth side up, into a generously oiled metal baking pan. Lightly drizzle with additional olive oil and stretch to fit the pan. Cover and let rest for 2 hours.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C)</li>
    <li>Unwrap and poke holes in the top of the dough using oiled fingers if desired for the traditional focaccia look. Scatter over rosemary and flaky sea salt.</li>
    <li>Bake in the center of the preheated oven until browned, about 30 minutes. Let cool in the pan for 10 minutes; transfer to a wire rack and let cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes. Slice and serve.</li>
